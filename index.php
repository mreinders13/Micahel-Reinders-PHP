<h1 style="font-weight: 100;">Welcome</h1>

<p>I can code and I love to do it. It doesnt matter if its software, databases, mobile applications, simple websites or complex servers. Give me a project and I will get it running. I dont do it because its easy, its not. I do it because its challenging, its interesting, its ever-changing and allows me to push my own limits and expand my mind. Knowledge is power, code makes sense and I <strike>want</strike> need to keep learning. Im no Expert, I make mistakes and I learn from them, but I dont fear them. Im eager to work and develop these skills. I just need the opportunity. If you have one, let me know.</p>
